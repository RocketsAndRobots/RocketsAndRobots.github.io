Hey there, I am a software developer working in the area of robotics with a big interest in the area of data science, computer vision and technology in general.
Apart from that I enjoy brewing and doing sport in the mountains.

### The blog

This will be a place to share all kind of topics regarding technologies and software development that I enjoy and I think are worth sharing. From time to time I might also
blog about technology unrelated topics :)
